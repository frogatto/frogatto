Steps for Playbook Release:
Set up frogatto. Follow this chat log:

11:54 < Sirp> asimonov: I assume I should update the Playbook OS?
11:54 < asimonov> what is it saying
11:54 < asimonov> what version is it now
11:55 < Sirp> it says it can update me to 2.0.1.166
11:55 < Sirp> it doesn't say which version it is now
11:56 < asimonov> yeah, do that
11:56 < Sirp> Okay It's 530MB so it might take a little while
11:56 -!- crimson_penguin [~ben@wesnoth/developer/crimsonpenguin] has joined #frogatto
11:57 < asimonov> well... i'm hoping you have something better than dialup
11:57 < asimonov> in the meantime you can set up the ndk :P
11:57 < asimonov> I'm assuming you got the signing keys
11:58 < Sirp> well I'm downloading the NDK
11:58 < Sirp> two 500MB downloads competing with each other. :)
11:59 < Sirp> fortunately each is going at like 1MBps
12:05 < asimonov> nice
12:06  * Sirp finds it bizarre that this NDK page auto-detects which download you should use, but then doesn't give you customized installation instructions. :p
12:08 < asimonov> Did everything download?
12:08 < asimonov> You will also have to grab a bunch of git repos
12:09 < Sirp> the NDK is downloaded and installing now
12:09 < asimonov> https://github.com/blackberry/SDL.git
12:09 < asimonov> https://github.com/blackberry/TouchControlOverlay.git
12:09 < asimonov> Do not put any of these in the NDK workspace directory
12:10 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/SDL_ttf.git
12:10 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/SDL_sound.git
12:10 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/SDL_mixer.git
12:10 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/SDL_image.git
12:11 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/vorbis.git
12:11 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/ogg.git
12:11 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/boost_system.git
12:11 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/boost_regex.git
12:11 < Sirp> so simply make clones of all those?
12:11 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/boost_iostreams.git
12:12 < asimonov> https://github.com/asimonov-rim/boost_headers.git
12:12 < asimonov> yes, just clone them
12:13 < asimonov> But again, do NOT put them in the NDK workspace directory. It will cause bad things to happen
12:13 < Sirp> okay I'm just cloning them in my home dir
12:13 < asimonov> that's fine
12:14 < asimonov> I blame the person that first checked in SDL into github... they did not name the repository properly
12:15 < asimonov> And, of course, you'll need my changes to frogatto
12:15 < Sirp> okay cloned them all
12:15 < asimonov> Did you open the NDK and did it ask you about the signing keys?
12:18 < Sirp> I haven't opened the NDK
12:18 < Sirp> running now...
12:19 < asimonov> Did it ask you about anything?
12:19 < Sirp> No it launched and is on a welcome screen where I can choose from some different options
12:19 < Sirp> Overview, First Steps, Samples, What's New, or Workbench
12:19 < asimonov> Just close that, I think
12:20 < Sirp> do I want to go to the Workbench?
12:20 < Sirp> or just close it?
12:20 < asimonov> Is the PlayBook alive?
12:20 < asimonov> close it
12:20 < asimonov> (the welcome screen)
12:20 < Sirp> well closing it closes down the NDK
12:21 < asimonov> Hmm... well... I guess you wanted to go to Workbench x.x
12:21 < asimonov> sorry about that
12:26 < asimonov> Ok, did your playbook upgrade yet?
12:35 < Sirp> so I'm at an empy workbench
12:36 < crimson_penguin> http://www.reddit.com/tb/qeg0a
12:36 < hagebake> hmm
12:36 < crimson_penguin> (note the text on the top)
12:36 < asimonov> Ok, import all of the projects into your workspace
12:37 < asimonov> File -> Import -> General -> Existing projects into workspace
12:37 < asimonov> If you give it the directory in which all of the projects are contained... it should find them all
12:38 < Sirp> okay my Playbook is done and ready to go
12:38 < asimonov> click on the icon that is to the right of the battery
12:39 < asimonov> Under Storage & Sharing, select "Connect to Windows" under USB connections
12:39 < asimonov> I'm assuming you're currently using Linux
12:40 < asimonov> Then under Security, go to Development Mode and enable it
12:43 < Sirp> okay did those things
12:44 < asimonov> remember the IP address
12:45 < asimonov> did a "Connected to Computer" screen come up?
12:51 < asimonov> I'm just going to assume that it did
12:52 < asimonov> Exit out of all of the settings and click on the icon to the left of the clock (looks like a man) and see what it says
12:53 < Sirp> sorry was getting food
12:54 < asimonov> Ok, tell me in which state you are
12:54 < Sirp> and I assume the Connected to Computer screen is meant to come up when I connect it to my computer?
12:54 < asimonov> it comes up multiple times
12:54 < Sirp> mmm so I plugged it into my computer and I don't see the screen
12:55 < asimonov> Did you set the Storage & Sharing stuff to Windows?
12:55 < Sirp> yes it has "USB Connections" Connect to Windows
12:56 < Sirp> (even though I'm using Linux)
12:57 < Sirp> and I'm plugging it into the same socket that the power cable that comes with it goes in -- that is correct, yes?
12:57 < asimonov> yes, there's only one micro-usb port
12:58 < asimonov> Did you enable Developer Mode?
12:58 < Sirp> yes
12:58 < asimonov> Did you click on the guy icon?
12:58 < Sirp> no ... you didn't have that until after saying the Connected to Computer screen would come up. :)
12:59 < Sirp> I can click it though
12:59 < asimonov> it's to the right of the clock (not left)
12:59 < asimonov> Tell me what it says
12:59 < Sirp> it says "Development Mode: On Expires in 10 days, IP Addresses: 169.254.0.1, 192.168.1.17
13:00 < asimonov> that sounds good... that means it thinks it's connected to your computer with 169.254.0.1
13:00 < asimonov> can you use ifconfig to check if your computer has a network interface with IP 169.254.0.2?
13:04 < Sirp> yes it does
13:04 < Sirp> through usb0 of course
13:04 < asimonov> of course
13:04 < asimonov> Ok, go to the NDK
13:05 < Sirp> okay in it
13:05 < asimonov> and go to the QNX System Information perspective
13:05 < asimonov> bluish button on the right
13:06 < Sirp> okay got it
13:07 < asimonov> Right click, new QNX target
13:07 < asimonov> and enter the ip of the device (169.254.0.1)
13:08 < Sirp> do you mean New Blackberry Tablet OS Target ?
13:08 < Sirp> I don't see new QNX Target
13:09 < asimonov> sure
13:09 < asimonov> I guess they renamed it
13:09 < asimonov> Actually, I'm just crazy
13:09 < asimonov> x.x
13:10 < Sirp> okay it made the target
13:10 < Sirp> and says it's connected
13:11 < asimonov> very good
13:11 < asimonov> ok... so did you import all of the projects?
13:12 < asimonov> all 13 of thenm
13:12 < Sirp> no
13:13 < Sirp> I haven't done any of that yet. How do I import projects?
13:13 < asimonov> [13:37] <asimonov> File -> Import -> General -> Existing projects into workspace [13:37] <asimonov> If you give it the directory in which all of the projects are contained... it should find them all
13:13 < Sirp> ahh that is nice
13:14 < Sirp> okay I did that and now it is "Refreshing Workspace"
13:15 < asimonov> Tell me when it's done that and you have 13 projects imported
13:15 < Sirp> okay it seems done ...
13:16 < Sirp> but I don't see any verification that the projects are imported
13:16 < asimonov> Switch back to the C/C++ perspective
13:16 < Sirp> like I selected the dir they are all in, and then it said "Refreshing Workspace" ...
13:16 < Sirp> ahhh okay
13:16 < Sirp> okay ...
13:16 < Sirp> okay so I have 12 projects ... I'm guessing the 13th is Frogatto itself?
13:16 < asimonov> They should appear on the left under Project Explorer
13:17 < asimonov> yes, frogatto is quite important in this :P
13:17 < Sirp> (well I have 13 because the device is also a 'project' apparently)
13:17 < Sirp> okay imported Frogatto also
13:18 < Sirp> it's still indexing the C++ but I assume that's concurrent
13:18 < asimonov> Ok, now verify that the SDL project is called SDL12
13:19 < Sirp> yes it's called SDL12
13:19 < asimonov> excellent
13:19 < Sirp> now build and run right? :)
13:20 < asimonov> right click on SDL12, Build Configurations -> Set Active -> Device-Debug
13:20 < asimonov> verify that it's Device-Debug for SDL, TouchControlOverlay and frogatto
13:20 < asimonov> I think the other ones should be fine, but these 3 I'm not sure about
13:21 < Sirp> ok yes it is
13:21 < Sirp> well TouchControlOerlay I had to change
13:21 < Sirp> but done now
13:21 < asimonov> Ok, right click on TouchControlOverlay and go to Properties
13:22 < asimonov> C/C++ Build -> Settings
13:22 < Sirp> okay...
13:22 < Sirp> okay...
13:22 < asimonov> Target
13:22 < asimonov> and set the runtime to C++ GNU with exceptions
13:23 < asimonov> otherwise stuff dies :(
13:24 < Sirp> okay done
13:24 < asimonov> Remember TouchControlOverlay... if you ever want to build in Device-Release mode you'll have to set the target for that as well
13:24 < asimonov> Otherwise Frogatto will die a horrible death when you start it
13:24 < asimonov> So... now start building them
13:25 < asimonov> Don't build boost_headers... since they are just headers
13:25 < Sirp> okay
13:25 < asimonov> right click  -> build project
13:25 < Sirp> is there an easy way to build all of them?
13:25 < asimonov> Currently, no... but I'm working on it for the future
13:26 < asimonov> The dependencies you can set up don't seem to work so great
13:26 < asimonov> the good news is that you won't have to rebuild the other projects very often
13:27 < Sirp> I tried selecting them all and right-clicking and building them all at once
13:28 < Sirp> SDL12 gives an error "cannot find -lTouchControlOverlay"
13:28 < Sirp> I assume I have to build TouchControlOverlay first?
13:28 < asimonov> yep
13:28 < Sirp> and we are doing a debug build here yes? So it won't necessarily go fast?
13:29 < asimonov> We didn't find much difference between Release and Debug actually
13:32 < Sirp> well does Release use -O2 ?
13:32 < Sirp> and does Debug ?
13:32 < asimonov> Release uses 02
13:33 < asimonov> *O2
13:33 < asimonov> Debug uses O0 and has symbols
13:33 < asimonov> Well, I'm sure there is some difference but not where it mattered to us
13:34 < Sirp> O0 and O2 usually has quite a large difference.
13:34 < Sirp> if it was mostly gpu bound rather than cpu bound then it wouldn't matter much
13:36 < Sirp> okay it built
13:36 < Sirp> there were warnings, but it built
13:36 < asimonov> frogatto built?
13:37 < Sirp> yes
13:38 < asimonov> right click on frogatto -> run as -> blackberry tablet c/c++ application
13:39 < Sirp> Create a new debug token and upload to the device?
13:39 < asimonov> It didn't ask you for signing keys yet, did it?
13:40 -!- hagebake [~quassel@unaffiliated/hagabaka] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
13:41 < Sirp> no
13:42 < asimonov> Hmm... go to Window -> Preferences -> BlackBerry Tablet OS
13:42 < asimonov> and run the Deployment Wizard from there
13:44 < Sirp> doing...
13:46 < Sirp> okay so this is where I use the CSJ files emailed to me...
13:46 < asimonov> yes
13:47 -!- Ivanovic [~ivanovic@dtmd-4d052c7e.pool.mediaWays.net] has quit [Changing host]
13:47 -!- Ivanovic [~ivanovic@wesnoth/developer/ivanovic] has joined #frogatto
13:51 < asimonov> Did it finish?
13:52 < Sirp> asimonov: still doing it...
13:52 < Sirp> okay finished
13:53 < Sirp> now what? Try running Frogatto again?
13:53 < asimonov> wait wait
13:53 < asimonov> I forgot
13:53 < asimonov> Go to Signing in the same menu
13:54 < asimonov> Under Window -> Preferences -> BlackBerry Tablet OS
13:54 < asimonov> Create a debug token and upload it
13:54 < asimonov> Unless that's done already
13:54 < Sirp> yes it created a debug token as part of that wizard
13:54 < Sirp> I got it to create a new one
13:55 < asimonov> did it say that it uploaded it?
13:55 < Sirp> I ... think so
13:56 < asimonov> Ok, so open bar-descriptor.xml file
13:56 < asimonov> and switch to the general tab
13:56 < asimonov> and click on Set from Debug Token
13:56 < asimonov> and save the file
13:56 < asimonov> something you recognize should appear in the Author field
13:57 < Sirp> well how do I find bar-descriptor.xml ?
13:57 < asimonov> Open the frogatto project
13:58 < Sirp> okay got it
13:58 < asimonov> it's probably the first file in there
13:58 < Sirp> ahh okay yes
13:58 < Sirp> done
13:59 < asimonov> Ok, so the Author field should have been updated... good
13:59 < asimonov> Now try running it
14:00 < Sirp> okay it's trying to launch it...
14:01 < asimonov> this will take.... a long ass while
14:01 < Sirp> :)
14:01 < asimonov> You will want to change some options when actually debugging stuff
14:01 < asimonov> But the app has to be loaded first using the slow method
14:02 < Sirp> ahh I see
14:04 < asimonov> Because it's packaging up all of the libraries and assets into a file and then uploading that
14:04 < asimonov> Afterwards you can just upload the frogatto binary, or the binary with libraries
14:04 < Sirp> ahhh I see
14:04 < asimonov> Or even nothing at all and just launch the executable (if you're debugging but not really changing any code)
14:08 < Sirp> asimonov: it's alive! :)
14:11 < Sirp> asimonov: seems to run really nicely too


Configuration for to release Cube Trains:
Testing:
 -- Make sure the compiled mode flag in prefrences.cpp is toggled appropriately. -- 
① Move the (slightly renamed) bar-descriptor file, and the master-config.cfg file, from the modules/cube_trains directory. (Replace the existing bar-descriptor.)
② Run "make assets", which will now compile Cube Trains data and images.
③ Checksum the .cfgs for release, so stats are reported.
④ In the IDE, select Run -> Run Configurations. Set Build Configuration to Device-Debug.
⑤ Make sure device-overlay's runtime is set to gnu-c++ with exceptions. (right-click menu -> Project Properties -> C/C++ build -> Setting -> target -> runtime)
⑥ Build everything but the overlay and the frogatto project. Rebuild once if errors.
⑦ Build the overlay project, then the frogatto project. You may have to tweak the Frogatto project by putting "#define GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED 0x8CDD // Krista's Hack for opengl 1 -> 2." near the top of texture_frame_buffer.cpp.
⑧ Once that's done, compile Cube Trains and then come back and refresh the IDE.
⑨ Upload and run the build on the PlayBook. If it works, proceed to step 7.
⑩ Repeat step two, but set the configuration to Device-Release.
⑪ Change the build target of your projects to Device-Release from Device-Debug from the right-click menu.
⑫ Recompile everything in order, and upload the project to the PlayBook.
 -- Put back the bar-descriptor when you've finished. --
