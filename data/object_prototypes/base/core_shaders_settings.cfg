	/*
		This prototype provides a bunch of settings which are intended to govern how the shader recolors/etc objects.  We've split the "settings for the shaders" and "actually using those settings" into two different files, at very different places in the hierarchy, because we've got a small problem with our shaders:  our built-in functionality to palette-recolor our terrain (and our terrain-like objects) is done via a shader, and, unfortunately, we can only ever apply one shader to an object at any given time.
		
		So if a shader is being applied to an object that uses the palette shifting, it'll instead show up as a black rectangle, which is very bad.  To fix this, we've made another prototype that "actually applies the settings" called `core_shaders` which gets applied above the `hittable` prototype, and only to the specific super-prototypes that are actually intended to use it.
