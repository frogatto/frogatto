prototype: ["cosmetic_effects"],
is_strict: true,

#	Transient objects are objects which are expected to occasionally get added-to, and removed-from the active game.

#	The main purpose of this prototype is to define common semantics for constructors/destructors, and to provide a certain set of really tricky behavior for them that's common to many objects, and is really tricky to get right, such as copy-constructors, and so on.  Some of this, like the copy-constructor stuff, will have to be duplicated inside of hittable because different properties need to be copied in there, but some of it at least will definitely be global.

#	The main thing these semantics enable is attaches - whilst hittable_attaches make no sense for objects that can't take damage, effects_attaches are display-only, and it's quite desirable to have things like shadows (or even glowing effects of some kind) on damage-agnostic entities like NPCs and so on.

#	One big style point we have here is we provide a few virtual functions we know are going to be needed, so that at the first few prototype tiers we don't have to do a boilerplate hook to the next level of functions.  Beyond that, we'll need to do a pattern where we do e.g.  `foo_prototype_destructor: "[custom_destructor, (foo code here)]"`
