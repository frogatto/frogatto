#	properties.damage_cooldown - how long the enemy will be invincible, used to cap the DPS of flamethrower-esque weapons, whilst allowing nigh-unlimited numbers of shots to make the attack easy to hit with.
#		Note that if cooldown is zero, the enemy should always take damage.
#	animation attack_area - an area that will trigger a hit
#	animation body_area - only set this if you want this shot to be neutralizable by enemy shots
