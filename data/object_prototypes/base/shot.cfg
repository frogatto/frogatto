expected things a user of this prototype must implement to deal damage

	properties.attack_knockback - a power-level for how hard it hits.
	properties.damage_cooldown - how long the enemy will be invincible, used to cap the DPS of flamethrower-esque weapons, whilst allowing nigh-unlimited numbers of shots to make the attack easy to hit with.
		Note that if cooldown is zero, the enemy should always take damage.
	animation attack_area - an area that will trigger a hit
	animation body_area - only set this if you want this shot to be neutralizable by enemy shots

		This is specifically for on_collide_level.  All that event provides is notification that our opaque pixels touched the level's solid pixels - it does nothing for our collide areas.  For most shots, this is fine and good, because their actual graphical size is quite small, but for some rather large shots like the player's super-shots, we want the area within which they hit enemies to be much, much larger than that within which they'll die from colliding with terrain - this is most prominent on the fireball - we want the targeting for it to be very, very forgiving - but at its default height off the ground (to be correctly spaced WRT the player), it's graphics are actually touching the ground, and it'd normally detonate there.
		
		Thus, what we do with shots like that is we actually give them a solid area, and keep them out of all the normal solid areas so this solid_area only collides when they hit the actual level itself.  We then use the following to prevent them from potentially double-triggering the event from multiple collide mechanisms (they'll handle self-destructing in their collide_ side/feet/head events).
		
		Note here that the value of solid_rect when it's null, outputs as:  {x: 0, y: 0, x2: 0, y2: 0, w: 0, h: 0}
	
		note: this `ignores_object_level_collisions` is JUST a "sensible default" - so that if we have a solid shot it automatically does what we describe above.
