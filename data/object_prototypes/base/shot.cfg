expected things a user of this prototype must implement to deal damage
	properties.attack_damage - how much damage is dealt
	properties.attack_knockback - a power-level for how hard it hits.
	properties.damage_cooldown - how long the enemy will be invincible, used to cap the DPS of flamethrower-esque weapons, whilst allowing nigh-unlimited numbers of shots to make the attack easy to hit with.
		Note that if cooldown is zero, the enemy should always take damage.
	animation attack_area - an area that will trigger a hit
	animation body_area - only set this if you want this shot to be neutralizable by enemy shots
