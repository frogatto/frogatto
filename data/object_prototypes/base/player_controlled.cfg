# This prototype is for all the game-mechanics that have nothing to do with how a player moves, but which track stuff to do with things like key input, score tracking, events, achievements, inventory, etc.  This stuff should be fairly portable across game genre types.
# This prototype is the one declared in module.cfg as "the" playable character object type in frogatto, which all playable characters must inherit from.  The purpose of this is to allow us to reference functions specific to the character in levels (like recording game events) without having to do a type declaration on every single line.
# Also, this prototype must avoid any sort of physics/gameplay interaction with anything in the game, because it is also used for menu controllers and such.

There is a lot more you can do with FFL, so have a look at the\ndocumentation on our wiki, https://github.com/frogatto/frogatto/wiki/.
