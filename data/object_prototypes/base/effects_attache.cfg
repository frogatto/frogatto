	/*
		Major warning here - our constructor runs *not only* when the object is first created, but will also be run every time the object is re-added to the game - if it's i.e. an object like a fiery glow that gets removed and added to an object.  The destructor will fire every time it's ripped off the original object, as well - we need to make sure nothing we fire in the constructor is a true 'can only happen once in an object's lifetime' command.  Currently we use no such things, so if they ever need to be added, we'll need to add some sort of guard statement to keep them from firing twice (all such setup events should be triggered in separate execution frames so we should be able to safely assume the side-effects from an earlier execution (such as a bool indicating we've previously been set up) will be visible to the later execution frame.

									/*								
										We can basically 'cancel' our death by anulling this scheduled_death_at value.  We want to do this if we're being transferred rather than our parent actually dying; this basically is our 'signal' that the death was a transfer.  We could do that with boolean flag, but we need to preserve the metadata of *which* death was being cancelled, because if we do a transfer and then the transferee gets killed, we want the final death to still be able to clean us up.
										
										Because of this we use a second numerical value; `recorded_transfer_at`.  It uses the same numerical calculation to generate the timestamp, so if it's the same as any `scheduled_death_at`, that means that particular death was a transfer, not an actual destruction.
										
										---
										
										TODO:
										There's one gotcha here - normally this handles situations where the parent immediately kills itself (a very common pattern we use is one where at the very moment of death for a 'thrown' object, we respawn one of the original objects that held it in place of where it currently sits.  We set all relevant variables for that object to be the same as the thrown object.  We do this to ensure that any special death code for the parent correctly gets run.  If this really breaks down, we still can't directly execute that code because of its calling context, but we can at least perhaps ditch the 'soft' part of this pattern - we still assume that the new object might want to cancel its death or something, and respawn with its old attaches.  Perhaps we'll switch to a 'hard' setup where if you're flagged for death, you just kill all your attaches, period.)
										
										I've recently noticed one odd bug: using the super poison attack, I was able to cause an ant_red_thrown to die and orphan its hp bar.  The bar still believed the thrown object was its parent.  The thrown object was part of the `evil_harmless` team.  It has a value for `recorded_transfer_at`, but no value for `scheduled_death_at`, and the parent was set to `currently_forcing_death`: true.
										
										~~This might be caused by some questionable timing about priority of when different objects get removed?~~
										
										Actually on further investigation, this is being caused by how our super-attacks consume enemies.
